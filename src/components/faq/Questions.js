    question: "How does Mersa work?",
    answer:
      "You can get set up and start receiving upfront capital for your contracts with just 3 steps, in under 24 hours. First, connect your existing subscription management, payment and accounting software to our platform. You will be assigned a trading limit, which is usually a % of your current revenue. Next, you will see a list of all your contracts that are eligible to be sold to investors. Select the ones you would like to sell to investors. Receive bids for your contracts and get anywhere between 1-3 years of upfront payment for each contract.",

  {
    question: "What is a trading limit and how do I increase it?",
    answer:
      "A trading limit is represented as a % of your trailing twelve months' ARR (annual recurring revenue). You may only sell contracts that add up to the value of your trading limit. The key to increasing your trading limit is to build up a trading history with mersa.",

  {
    question: "How are my contracts priced?",
    answer:
      "After you connect to our systems, our algorithm assigns you a recommended range within which to price your contracts. Typically, it's in the form of 'x cents to the dollar'. You can also set a minimum price below which you will not accept offers. From here on, mersa works like any other stock exchange. Investors submit bids for your contracts and the highest prices get fulfilled.",

    question: "What happens if a contract churns?",
    answer:
      "You simply replace the churned customer contract with an existing contract of equivalent value that has not yet been listed with mersa.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you revenue financing or contract invoicing?",
    answer:
      "Nope. We do not underwrite contracts or collect payments on your behalf. We also do not charge you a fee for taking on your risk. We are best thought of as a stock exchange for companies with recurring revenues to sell their contracts to investors and fuel their growth without raising equity financing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my contracts sold at a steep discount?",
    answer:
      "Nope. We understand that your company's valuation is determined by revenue growth, and as such we ensure that the typical discount rate is between 85-95 cents on the dollar. This is far lower than the discount of 25-30% most companies give their customers on annual deals.",
